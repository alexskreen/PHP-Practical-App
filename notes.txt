Variable types
  variables are kind of like containers/elements used to store data. Then we can use the data by using the variable name

  $ following the name of the variable
  strings are in "" or ''
  integers don't need "" or ''
  
  variables should be written in camelCase, 

  concatenation with . between

Math
  works the same way as it does in JS

Arrays
  works the same way as it does in JS

Associative Arrays
  $someArray = ["key" => "value", "key2" => "value2"]
  echo $someArray['key'] will give you "value"

If Statements
  works the same way as it does in JS

Comparison and logical operators
  works the same way as it does in JS

Switch Statements

For Loop
  same as JS

foreach
  foreach($variables as $variable){

  }

  Global/Local variable scope:
    outside of function: Global
    inside of function: Local
      unless you declare it as global $variable = 
  
  Constant
    define("VARIABLENAME", "value")
    newer way
      const VARIABLE = "value"
      works with all data types
